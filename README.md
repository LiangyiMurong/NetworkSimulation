# NetworkSimulation

## Venture Capital(vc) Industry Network Analysis:

### Files:

**main.py**: Instantiate the class NetworkSimulation with different initial parameters for constructing different graph, 
the class contains functions to calculate correlation, gini correlation, average converging time, status quality reordering
and status quality gap, and can be called to generate the graphs according to requirements.

**formula.py**: Contains the functions for doing the small tasks in updating the graph, calculating necessary statistics, and ranking

**update_node.py**: Contains functions to update each nodes in each round and functions to update the graph.

**ultimate_simulation.py**: For the 1210 * 100 times simulation.

**utilities.py**: Mainly contains function to visualize the results or intermediate result.
